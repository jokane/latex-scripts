- Separate dot-building logic into a new script 'dot2eps'.
- Separate dependency-finding logic to a new script 'texdeps'.  (?)
- Comment-tag to add a dependency regex.
- Use PID-dependent temporary file name, to allow recursive texmake.
- latex2dvi: Check error codes for custom before/after commands.  Fail when those commands fail.
- latex2dvi: Show errors from makeindex.
- latex2dvi: halt-on-error?
- texmake: Add comment-tags for "conditions", and refuse to compile if the
  conditions are not met.  Can prevent copy-paste errors.  Example: grep for
  current year, don't compile if previous years appear.  Example: Match number
  in \documentname with number in filename.
